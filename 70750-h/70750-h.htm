<h2 class="nobreak" id="LABORS_ATTITUDE_TOWARD_PRISONERS_LABOR">LABOR’S ATTITUDE TOWARD PRISONERS’ LABOR</h2>
</div>

<p class="center caption"><span class="smcap">By John J. Sonsteby</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>[This address, which we print in large part, was read by Mr. Sonsteby at the recent Rhode Island state conference
of charities and correction. It seems an excellent statement from the standpoint of organized labor.</p>

<p>The Review will be glad to print authoritative statements from other persons holding other views on the prison labor
problem.—<span class="smcap">Editor.</span>]</p>
</div>

<p>In speaking to the subject of labor’s
attitude toward convict labor, I speak
from the standpoint of organized union
labor, and through it to the free labor
of our country.</p>

<p>I speak particularly for the United
Garment Workers of America, a union
whose membership is largely composed
of women and girls, and which is subjected
to more competition with convict
labor than almost any other union or
trade.</p>

<p>Organized labor has taken a positive
stand and has an attitude toward convict
labor. That attitude is practically no different
from the attitude of other citizens
who have given the subject careful
thought and who are not financially interested,
directly or indirectly, in the
labor of convicts.</p>

<p>I have found whenever labor men,
manufacturers, sociologists and other
financially disinterested people have discussed
the question there has been an almost
unanimity of opinion.</p>

<p>The attitude of free labor toward convict
labor finds expression only through
the means afforded by the labor unions.
Unorganized free labor is what the name
implies, and has no authorized person
to speak for it. Organized labor’s attitude
toward convict labor is, therefore,
the only one capable of being crystalized
and expressed.</p>

<p>Free labor is unalterably opposed to
convict labor as it is commonly understood
to-day, viz.: The competition of
the products of convict labor with that
of free labor on the open market. Free
labor favors prison labor for the purpose
of keeping prisoners employed, training
them for their duties as citizens when
they are released, and making products
for the state and the state institutions.</p>

<p>Speaking before a subcommittee of
the committee on labor, in the house of
representatives, in March, 1910, Mr.
Thomas F. Tracey, representing the
American federation of labor, said, in
part: “The labor organizations of this
country, as typified by the American federation
of labor, have not, are not, and
should never help in the advocacy of anything
that would put prisoners in idleness.
We want those who are the outcasts
of society, and who are confined in
prisons to be allowed to do work—such
work as will be beneficial to them; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
we do not believe that, when these men
are confined in prisons, instead of their
labor being put in the direction of either
grinding out dividends for stockholders
of concerns of this kind (prison contractors),
or making profits for the state,
their efforts should be rather in the direction
of educating them and reforming
them to lead better lives.”</p>

<p>The foregoing sentiment represents
the altruistic attitude of the American
labor movement.</p>

<p>What reason is there for an expression
of labor’s attitude? People who have a
selfish purpose to serve have directly and
by innuendo charged labor unions with
selfishly endeavoring to keep all prisoners
in idleness, so that no products from
convict labor would be manufactured.
Organized labor has never been guilty of
such an endeavor, and its attitude has
been intentionally and insistently misrepresented
by those who knew better.</p>

<p>That the inmates of penal and reformatory
institutions must have employment
if the object of their confinement is to
be attained, is admitted by all. That this
employment will, in some degree, compete
with free labor, is also true. That
at the present time this employment of
convict labor does compete with free
labor, and compete in a demoralizing way
with it, is recognized by all who are informed.
People who do not come in
contact with prison labor or the products
of prison labor, do not realize what the
competition of the convict labor means.
Organized labor believes that the employment
of convict labor should be so
diversified that the burden will be equally
distributed among all free labor, and reduced
to such a minimum that the members
of no trade or occupation can justly
complain.</p>

<p>The two dominant ideas in prison management
heretofore have been simply retribution
and economy. The possibility
of reforming convicts who are within
prison walls—reforming them by useful,
educative labor—is a comparatively new
idea, and not accepted by all those in
charge of convicts. Organized labor believes
in reforming the convicts and returning
them as soon as possible to society,
mentally and morally sound and
willing and able to take their places in
the rank of wage earners. It costs money
to train morals or to do educational or
reformatory work. It takes effort, time,
money, and interest to diversify employment
among convicts so as to render such
employment educative and beneficial to
the convicts, and, at the same time, not
unfair to free labor.</p>

<p>The desire on the part of many managers
and prison officials to make penal
and reformatory institutions self supporting
is one of the causes for their failure
up to the present time to arrive at a
successful solution of the convict labor
question. Another reason for the failure
to successfully solve the question has
been the fast disappearing but still remaining
spoils system in politics, which
gives to the local merchants contracts to
supply the needs of the state and state
institutions. The usual form of prison
labor is not reformative.</p>

<p>The problems to which all right thinking
people should apply themselves is to
adopt or evolve some system of employment
that is fair to free labor, and then
endeavor to have such a system uniform
throughout the United States. Until
some uniform system of disposing of the
products of convicts is adopted, there
should be a federal law enacted providing
that each state shall have the right to
regulate the sale of prison-made goods
within its own borders. Such a bill, has
been pending for a number of years in
the congress of the United States. Each
state should dispose of, within its own
borders, the products of its own penal
institutions.</p>

<p>The systems in vogue in our penal
institutions at the present time are commonly
known as:</p>

<ol><li>
Contract labor (indoors).</li><li>
Contract labor (outdoors).</li><li>
Piece-price plan.</li><li>
Lease system (outdoors).</li><li>
State account: products sold on open market.</li><li>
State account: for state use.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of these, the contract labor and lease
systems have been universally condemned.
At the present time, each state has its
own system, or lack of system of handling
the convict labor question. Each
state endeavors to avoid competition with
free labor in its own particular state. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
do this, many contracts provide that the
product shall not be sold within the state
where it is made, and as a result the
free labor in all the states is subject to
about the same competition because of
this interstate commerce in prison-made
goods.</p>

<p>The farming out and disposing of the
labor of convicts by contracts to private
persons or corporations, is the most pernicious
form of competition to which
free labor is subjected. The piece-price
plan and state-account, when the product
is disposed of on the open market, either
to favored persons or corporations, or
without regard to market conditions or
prevailing market price, is not much better.
All of these systems except the
state account plan, where the product is
used by the state or state institutions,
tend toward the concentrating of the productions
into a few trades. The concentrating
of prison-made goods into a
few trades is bitterly opposed by free
labor. Such products are sold in the
open market at less than the market
prices, and this unfair, cruel competition
drives free manufacturers out of business,
free workmen out of employment,
and puts a penalty on the wage-earner
who keeps out of prison.</p>

<p>The old systems of labor have been
tried, have been weighed in the balance
and found wanting. The story of graft
and corruption of prison officials who
have had anything to do with contracts
for prison labor under any system, except
the state account plan, where the
products are used by the state, or in the
state institutions, has aroused almost
every state in our Union. The reports
of state investigating committees and of
committees appointed by civic organizations,
are such as to be almost unbelievable.
The abuses, the atrocities, the
crimes that are committed in the use of
convict labor, have brought down the
condemnation of all right thinking citizens,
and created a demand for a system
of labor that will not be subject to those
conditions.</p>

<p>In the movement for better conditions,
organized labor takes a stand in the
front rank. Of all of the systems of
work that have been used in the various
penal institutions the one most successful
is the state account system by which
the labor of the convicts is used for the
state, and the products for the state institutions.
This system eliminates nearly
all incentive to bribery of prison officials,
the exploitation of convict labor and the
opposition to the parole laws. Under it
the whole people get whatever benefits
may be derived from the labor of the
prisoners of the state.</p>

<p>Organized labor is on record as favoring
this system. When the prison
officials recognize that the profits of the
prisoners’ labor belongs to the state, that
the state is more interested in reforming
the prisoner than making a profit on
him, such officials thereupon become
much better officials for the state as a
whole.</p>

<p>The efforts of the prison officials are
thereafter directed toward curing our
morally sick men and women, and new
and various methods are tried. In this
connection I might mention the experiment
as reported in the press of September
30, of this year, of Ray Baker,
warden of the Nevada state penitentiary,
who, in company with three unarmed assistants,
took fifty-two convicts, many of
them life termers, to attend a theatrical
performance. Every convict was upon
honor, and not one violated his word.</p>

<p>How many of our prison officials will
hold up their hands in holy horror at
such unconventional conduct on the part
of the warden?</p>

<p>Slavery and involuntary servitude except
as a punishment for crime is forbidden
in the United States by the thirteenth
amendment to the constitution. It is by
this amendment that the state has any
right in the labor of convicts. That right,
I think, should only exist when the convict
labors for the state or its institutions.
Where the state through its courts
has no power, as punishment for crime,
to sentence a convict to labor for private
persons, it should have no right to do so
directly by contracts with private persons
providing for the labor or the product
of the labor of the convicts.</p>

<p>Under the plan organized labor favors,
the convicts are always under the
control of the state and its authorized
officials. They may be shifted from one
form of work to another as the needs of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
the state or the health and training of
the convicts require.</p>

<p>Every convict who has no trade and is
capable of learning one should be taught
one most suitable for him. Not in a haphazard,
spasmodic way, but in a way that will
make him an efficient, intelligent mechanic,
retaining skill, and able to follow
the trade when he is released. In the arrangement
of employment for the prisoners
the state should endeavor to supply
itself with everything necessary in its
various institutions. Convicts should be
employed as nearly as possible at the
work they are accustomed to, especially
if they are skilled mechanics, in order
that they should not lose their skill. A
large proportion of the convicts are men
accustomed to outdoor life, either on
farms or other outdoor labor; many of
them are convicted of crimes in no way
violent or due to vicious or violent dispositions.</p>

<p>To confine men of this kind in cells
and compel them to work in shops is to
endanger their health, break them down
physically, and return them to society
not only morally sick, but also physically
and mentally sick.</p>

<p>The death rate from tuberculosis is
much higher in prisons than outside. In
some prisons the conditions are such that
a sentence of five years or more means
almost invariably another case of tuberculosis
and death.</p>

<p>The danger to the public from the
clothing and other products made by
these tuberculosis infected convicts is so
great that if the public only knew the
facts, prompt remedial legislation would
be forced. The states are spending millions
of dollars annually to eliminate or
reduce the great “white plague,” yet at
the same time they are maintaining also
at public expense some of the worst
causes. These convicts are returned to
society about every five years, and the
product of their labor is in every state in
the Union. Is it not better and cheaper
to prevent tuberculosis by wiping out
one of its most prolific causes than to
let it continue to spread pain, misery and
death, among our people who have committed
no crime?</p>

<p>As large an amount of outdoor work
as possible should be provided. A large
farm should be operated, on which not
only necessary foodstuffs be raised, but
a flour mill for the grinding of flour and
all other necessary plants for the turning
of the different raw products into the finished
articles needed in the various institutions.
The making of roads is
needed in almost every state, and is an
ideal occupation for convicts. After providing
for the needs of the state and
state institutions the surplus labor could
be used in this way. Only those convicts
should be put to work on the roads who
have been convicted of minor offenses,
and can be trusted without ball and chain
and armed guards. In this day of speedy
communications by telegraph, telephone
and wireless, the old restraints are very
much less needed.</p>

<p>At the present time none of the prisons
of the country are self-supporting. All
of these penal institutions are a burden
on taxpayers of this country. All free
workmen are taxpayers of the state,
either directly or indirectly. It is unfair
that any one part of the taxpayers should
be discriminated against by the state.
Concentrating the labor of prisoners in
an institution into a few trades forces
the free labor in those trades to enter
into competition with the state. The selling
of convict labor products on the open
market in competition with free labor,
at any price, throws free taxpayers, into
ruthless competition with the state. Using
convict labor to furnish the needs of
the state and state institutions not only
removes the state from the market for
free labor, but also permits free manufacturers
to meet each other in fair, free
competition. They are then all equal as
to labor costs, no products of slave labor
being thrown at any price on the open
market.</p>

<p>Organized labor asks no special privileges
in this matter, but wants simply
that each free laborer be treated the same
as every other free man; that he pay only
his just share of the tax necessary to the
maintenance of the state and its penal
institutions; that he be subjected to only
his fair share of the competition incident
to the manufacture of any product within
the penal institutions; that a system
of employment be inaugurated and maintained
in the penal institutions of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
country that will educate and reform the
convicts; that the products of all convict
labor should be used entirely by the
state and institutions of the state, where
the convict is incarcerated; that the labor
of the convicts should be so diversified
that the burden will fall as equally as possible
on all free labor within the state;
that the exploitation of convicts or their
labor or the products of their labor
for the benefit of individuals be not permitted
in any form; that a rate of compensation
be allowed for the product of
convicts based upon the labor costs outside
prisons, and that, after deducting
from the earnings of the convicts the
cost of maintenance and other proper and
necessary costs, the balance should be
used either for the dependent family of
the convict, the reimbursement of those
who have been injured or suffered
through the crime, of the convict, or kept
for the use of the convict and given to
him when he is released; that when a
convict is discharged or paroled, a place
be provided for his care until he is able
to secure employment in the line he has
been taught, and means provided to secure
him employment.</p>

<p>In all movements for the betterment
of prisoners and the welfare of prisoners,
organized labor has assisted. Every
law enacted in the United States, changing
and bettering prison conditions has
either been initiated or strongly supported
by the labor unions. The improvement
of sanitary conditions in the
prisons; the providing of dining rooms
are all improvements largely due to the
efforts made by organized labor.</p>

<p>The adoption of the foregoing plans
will make of the penal institutions of
our country industrial institutions for
the saving of morally sick men and
women committed to them. The inmates
of such institutions will return to the
body politic with a corrected perspective
due to a training under a state government
that desires to reform as well as
correct. They will again take their
places in society not only willing, but able
to do their share of the world’s work.
This is the attitude of organized labor
toward convict labor.</p>

<p class="center caption"><span class="smcap">By O. F. Lewis, General Secretary</span></p>

<p class="center caption"><span class="smcap">Prison Association of New York</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>[In the Summer of 1911, Mr. Lewis traveled through Belgium, Holland, Germany, England and Scotland, studying
European methods of dealing with delinquents, and especially the beggar colonies of Central Europe. The following
article is a part of one chapter of Mr. Lewis’s report to the Prison Association of New York, which will be
presented to the Legislature in 1912. The report has special significance because the state of New York is to build
a compulsory farm colony for habitual tramps and vagrants.]</p>
</div>

<p>Foreign countries, notably Belgium,
Holland and Germany, have had lengthy
and varied experience with the problem
of vagabondage and mendicancy. Indeed
in Central Europe the vagrancy
problem is not alone a generation old,
but a century old. Napoleon devoted
some of his genius to the problem of the
suppression of vagabondage. When the
Dutch possessed Belgium as well as
Holland, Dutch benevolent societies
sought the reformation and rehabilitation
of the vagabond. A half
century ago Holland was segregating
over one thousand vagabonds and beggars
on the bleak heath in the north of
Holland near the Zuyder Zee and already
turning the arid plain into a blooming
oasis. Belgium was creating fifty
years ago local beggar colonies, and recognizing
that vagrancy is one of the
great social dangers of a nation, a danger
increasing inevitably with the progress
of civilization. Germany was
thirty years ago this year establishing its
first voluntary labor colony at Bielefeld
in Central Prussia. Pastor von Bodelschwingh,
the great organizer of philanthropic
institutions for defectives of all
kinds, founded with deep religious conviction
his first farm colony for the
“brothers of the highway.” Compulsory
workhouses, semi-penal in nature, have
come to number about thirty in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
kingdom of Prussia, containing not
thieves, not cases of assault, not robbers,
not other criminals of greater or less
degree, but solely vagrants, mendicants,
and that despicable class of human beings,
the souteneurs, who traffic in human
flesh.</p>

<p>Today the accumulated experience of
generations can be found in the records
and in the methods of administration of
Belgian beggar colonies, Dutch vagrancy
colonies, German free labor colonies
and German compulsory workhouses. It
is unthinkable that the United States,
ever ready in commercial and industrial
lines to profit not only by the mistakes
but by the successes of other nations,
will be blind to the wealth of experience
that European countries can offer us.</p>

<p>With the purpose of rendering a
slight contribution to American information
on this subject, a considerable part
of my last summer’s tour in Belgium,
Holland, Germany, England and Scotland,
as general secretary of the prison
association of New York, was devoted
to the first-hand study of the administration
of institutions for vagrants and
mendicants and the study also of their
history and of the laws under which at
various times they have been operated.
In several chapters following this introductory
chapter I present a somewhat
careful study of Merxplas the world-famous
beggar colony of Belgium; of
Veenhuizen, the less known but remarkably
interesting vagrancy colony of Holland;
of the free labor colonies and the
compulsory workhouses of Prussia and
Germany; and of conditions and problems
of vagrancy in England and Scotland.</p>

<p>Several general observations may well
precede the special chapters.</p>

<p>1. In all four of the countries above
mentioned (Belgium, Holland, England
and Scotland) the correctional institutions
in which vagrants and mendicants
are confined are under the same governing
body as that which governs the prisons.
In Belgium and Holland, the department
of justice controls the beggar
colonies and the vagrancy colonies. In
England and Scotland the boards of
prison commissioners are the governing
bodies not only for the convict prisons
in which the more serious offenders are
imprisoned, but also the local prisons,
which are the places of imprisonment of
beggars and mendicants. In Prussia,
the Arbeitshâuser (compulsory workhouses)
are under provincial, not royal
control. In short, in Prussia compulsory
workhouses are county institutions,
or in the case of Berlin municipal institutions,
rather than state institutions.
We find, herefore, in Holland and Belgium
special institutions for the imprisonment
of vagrants and mendicants controlled
by the state, in Prussia special institutions
for the imprisonment of vagrants
and mendicants controlled by the
provinces corresponding in general to
our American counties; we find in England
and Scotland local prisons, not specially
designated for vagrants and mendicants,
controlled by the state through
boards of prison commissioners. While
in Prussia the American student might
perhaps expect under provincial (county)
management a condition analogous
to the indifferent if not highly neglectful
management of correctional institutions
so familiar to American students, where
politics rule in county affairs, the fact is
that the Prussian county compulsory
workhouses are managed with that German
thoroughness, efficiency, and integrity
which makes these county institutions,
so far as my observations went,
fully comparable with the management
of the state prisons and penitentiaries.</p>

<p>The important point is that the state,
or in Prussia the county, can organize
and operate its institutions for vagrants
and mendicants independent of petty
local prejudices or ignorance, and regardless
of pernicious political influences.
If the state concludes to institute
in its labor colonies or other institutions
an innovation or a method well
tested elsewhere, it has the power. As
with us in New York, state institutions
are in general far better managed than
the local institutions, so in European
countries I visited the principle of state
control and operation of all correctional
institutions is held to be fundamentally
correct. If in Prussia the local institutions
were poorly managed, undoubtedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
the state would seek to step in and take
over the management of these institutions.
Briefly then, it can be stated that
state control and operation of institutions
for the treatment of vagrants and
tramps is a principle justified by European
experience.</p>

<p>2. In all European countries visited, I
found a most admirable absence of political
influence. Repeatedly it was impressed
upon me by high authorities that
politics play no deleterious part in the
appointments of officials, high or low,
in the course of justice. To be sure
each country has its political parties, but
the integrity of men in office is, I was
informed, rarely if ever questioned. Positions
such as secretary-general of the
department of justice, which office carries
with it in Holland and Belgium the
administration of prisons and other correctional
institutions, or that of the head
of the Prussian prison system, or that
of chairman of the prison commissioners
of England or Scotland is practically a
position of life tenure, during good behavior.
Governors and directors of prisons,
and subordinate officials as well,
hold office without fear of removal for
any cause except dereliction of duty, incompetency
or immorality. Frequently
indeed was the plea made to me: “Urge
above all things the removal of American
prisons from politics.” In short,
the type of prison employee from governor
down to the list of attendants is,
from the standard of integrity, admirable
in all countries I visited. That such
conditions make for good service through
the elimination of the worry as to tenure
and through the elimination of voluntary
or compulsory dishonesty under
the pressure of political influences is
self-evident.</p>

<p>3. On the continent vagrants and
mendicants as found in the colonies and
in the compulsory workhouses are very
noticeably different from our typical
tramp or vagrant, in that the European
tramp in prison is much older than our
typical youthful or young adult wanderer.
In Merxplas and in Veenhuizen
the young tramp was a rarity. Perhaps
ninety-five per cent. of the population
of the colonies was at least forty-five
years old. The population of the several
compulsory workhouses visited in Prussia
averaged somewhat younger, but nevertheless
was considerably older than
the average age of our tramp army.</p>

<p>Added to this was the fact, everywhere
observable, that the great majority
of the tramps and vagrants possessed
a trade. They could accomplish at least
moderate results with their hands and
they seemed to wish to do satisfactory
work to a reasonable extent. As illustrations
I cite the tailoring department, the
shoe making department and the trunk
department at Merxplas, and the weaving
and the carpentry work at Veenhuizen.
The great majority of the vagrants
and the beggars who are segregated
in Holland, Belgium and Germany
are men who know how to do things
with their hands and heads sufficiently
well to earn a living, but who are either
physically or mentally so under par that
they cannot work hard enough, or will
not save money enough, to render them
permanently self supporting. Hence
they gravitate, generally without marked
criminal instincts or intentions, into vagabondage
or vagrancy, are arrested, and
sent or returned to the beggar colony. In
these colonies, under a control which
they are not adverse to, and with a
shifting of responsibility which they are
glad of, they produce a moderate amount
of product with a moderate amount of
pleasure in their work. The directors of
the colonies and other representatives of
the departments of justice claim that the
men are happier in the colonies and are
better off by far than they would be outside.</p>

<p>4. The beggar colonies and the compulsory
workhouses are in practically no
sense reformatories. The importance of
this fact cannot be over-emphasized.
There seems to be a rather general belief
in the United States that farm colonies
for tramps and vagrants will be
important reformative agencies. European
experience is directly contrary to
this belief. European sociologists, directors
of colonies, prison physicians, or
prison commissioners without exception
stated emphatically to me that the percentage
of reformation (by which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
meant fairly permanent rehabilitation)
is exceedingly small from the colonies
and the compulsory workhouses. The
history of beggar colonies in Belgium
and Holland shows that those colonies
began with large hopes of reformation
and that in the course of years and generations
it has become thoroughly manifest
that the tramp and vagrant is what
he is through a lack of stamina, will,
physique or brain, whatever we may call
it in the individual instance, without
which it is impossible for him to lead a
normal and self-supporting existence.
Just as we in the United States are coming
to see that the feeble-minded criminal
and non-criminal are chronically deficient
and that feeble-mindedness means
an absence of a quality which cannot be
replaced or cured, so with vagrancy and
its twin sister mendicancy, European
conclusions are emphatic that vagrancy
and mendicancy, especially in the more
advanced stages, must be regarded as
manifestations of a social inefficiency
and incompetency which require segregation
and custodial care, in most instances
permanently or for long periods.</p>

<p>If ever a labor colony was organized
and conducted with the earnest purpose
of reformation of a large proportion of
its inmates, the voluntary labor colony
at Bielefeld was such a one. Yet after
thirty years the parent colony, known
throughout the civilized world and
quoted more than any other of its kind,
bears this testimony through its secretary,
given to me on August 6, 1911:
“This colony is not successful in reforming
many men or in making them
permanently self supporting. This colony
is successful in furnishing, as do
the score of other colonies in Germany,
a haven to the “brothers of the highway”
who are stranded and unable to live honestly
without our help. This colony is a
colony not for the permanent rehabilitation
of its inmates, but for the temporary
succor of those who seek our help.
A large proportion of our brothers come
time and again to see us. They think
themselves strong enough to leave us,
but they come back. If they do not
come to us, they go to other colonies
from time to time. Many of our colonists
are discharged prisoners. Many
of them are at times in the voluntary
labor colonies, at times in the compulsory
workhouses. We have many instances
of successful reformation and
rehabilitation, but the voluntary labor
colony as represented by Bielefeld colony
has not solved the problem of the
elimination of the tramp.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, opinion is general
that the compulsory labor colony as represented
by the beggar colony or compulsory
workhouse is of great value as
a deterrent and as a custodial institution.
None of the countries would, I
believe, give up the colony idea, although
statements were frequently made
that the colony should be smaller, classifications
more developed and that the
efforts to influence for the better the individual
colonists should be more frequent
and varied. At Merxplas the secretary
general of the Belgian department
of justice, the administrative head
of the Belgian system, stated to me that
Belgium is planning numerous smaller
colonies to take the place of Merxplas.
The feeling is pronounced in Belgium,
Holland and Germany that the most that
can be achieved by any present method
of dealing with vagrants is the gradual
reduction of the number of vagrants,
the deterrence of many would-be vagrants,
and the segregation of a large
number of inevitable vagrants and beggars
where they may do the least harm
to society at a minimum expense to society.</p>

<p>Although vagrants in the colonies and
the workhouses manifest in general a
restlessness and a frequent desire for
liberty, they are themselves aware that
their condition in general is better in the
colonies than outside. Indeed, at Merxplas,
and particularly at Veenhuizen the
American visitor finds a beauty of landscape
and a condition of intensive development
of garden and meadow, grove
and forest, canal and highway that renders
both institutions scenically beautiful.</p>

<p>The Prussian compulsory workhouse,
Brauweiler, is most attractively located
in a renovated cloister, the original
buildings of which are 1,000 years old.
The spacious rooms, the impressive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
arched corridors, the striking central
courts of the cloister as well as the well
preserved cloister church dating back to
the tenth century, are all impressive and
even awe-inspiring. The workhouse
prisoners eat in cloistered passages
where 500 years ago the monks had their
daily meals. The prisoners worship in
a church used by royalty and nobles at
the time of the crusades. Even a spreading
mulberry tree in one of the court
yards, furnishing shade from time to
time for some of the inmates, was
planted a thousand years ago by the
founders of the monastery. In Rummelsburg,
adjacent to Berlin, the walled
workhouse embraces ample grounds, a
spacious garden and attractive buildings.
At Veenhuizen in Holland, the heath has
been made to blossom like the rose and
no finer views of Holland scenery can
be found than those in the midst of the
7,000 acres embraced by the colony.</p>

<p>5. Not only do the vagrants live under
such surroundings, but in nearly all instances
they and their predecessors have
thus created their surroundings. Merxplas
and Veenhuizen were as the rest
of the heath when they were founded.
Today the cold north wind, blowing
down from the North Sea, is checked
before striking the grounds and buildings
of Veenhuizen by forests planted
by the colonists a generation or more
ago. The large dormitories, accommodating
500 men each, in which the Merxplas
colonists sleep, were built by colonists
most of whom have passed away.
The arable farm land of Merxplas,
which now supplies the bulk of the vegetable
products needed by the colony,
was made fertile by gangs of colonists
in previous years who rooted out the
weeds and heather and utilized the street
sweepings of Antwerp in a mixture of
top soil. Shops, churches, officers’ quarters,
farm buildings, farm implements
and wagons have been built by the colonists
in these several institutions. Stock
has been bred and raised at the colony
and to the maximum extent the colonists
are rendered self supporting. In addition,
industries are maintained to the
maximum extent possible with hand and
foot power, it being still a literal principle
in the colonies and in the workhouses
that by the sweat of his brow
shall the colonist earn his bread. Oftentimes
the rigor of the work impressed
me unpleasantly, particularly the weaving
by hand and foot power at Merxplas
and at Veenhuizen, which was carried
on by many aged men who in our country
would seem candidates for an idle
almshouse life.</p>

<p>In short, one of the important lessons
taught by the colonies and the workhouses
is that there is in tramps and
vagrants (at least in Central Europe) a
very large amount of latent productivity,
which directed normally and under conditions
offering the least resistance can
be made financially profitable to the
state.</p>

<p>6. European vagrants and beggars
seem seldom malicious and vicious. The
colonies in Belgium and Holland are not
regarded as penal institutions, and in
Prussia as only semi-penal. Discipline
is comparatively easy, the proportion of
infractions of rules varying largely in
proportion to the tact, discretion and humanity
of the director and of his assistants.
Throughout the Merxplas colony
the words docility and disobedience kept
recurring to my mind. In Merxplas and
Veenhuizen the men come and go without
the restriction of walls. Escape is
easy and the possibilities are often taken
advantage of. As noted in the special
chapters that follow, little is done to follow
up this escape so long as the fugitives
show a disposition to re-establish
themselves in industrial life. “Peace
and good will” seem to be mottoes in the
colonies. In the Merxplas colony one
finds many mottos printed in French and
Flemish admonishing the colonists to
forsake the vices and cleave to the virtues.
Other religious influences, however,
are not very noticeable. By comparison,
the atmosphere of Bielefeld, a
voluntary labor colony of Prussia, seems
permeated with devoutness and outward
religious observance.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="GOVERNOR_WESTS_PRISON_POLICY">GOVERNOR WEST’S PRISON POLICY</h2>
</div>

<p class="center caption"><span class="smcap">By Rev. O. A. Stillman</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>[The prison policies of several governors have lately attracted attention, notably those of Governor West of Oregon,
Schafroth of Colorado, Foss of Massachusetts and Gilchrist of Florida. The following article, written by one closely in
touch with Oregon prison conditions and published in “Lend a Hand,” is a useful outline of Governor West’s work
in Oregon for prison betterment.]</p>
</div>

<p>There has been much comment in the
papers and magazines lately regarding
Governor West’s prison policy; some of
which has been written in a friendly
spirit, some of it in a spirit of criticism,
and some of it, while undoubtedly written
in a friendly spirit, has, because of
insufficient information, had rather the
result of putting the governor and his
policies in a false light.</p>

<p>Some of these writers, probably with
the best intentions, have given the impression
that Governor West’s policy
flashed upon the unmitigated horrors of
the Oregon state penitentiary like a flash
of lightning out of a clear sky, without
any preparation or previous warning. If
this had been true, it would probably have
resulted only in disaster, as far as the
policy is concerned, and in making the
governor appear rash and inconsiderate,
if not ridiculous.</p>

<p>Nothing could be further from the
truth. Governor West knew perfectly
well what he was doing, and, so far as
I have been able to judge, he has been
eminently wise in his reforms. He has
not entered into this work without having
given a great deal of study to its problems,
and he seems to have a large fund
of information regarding the conditions
he is trying to meet.</p>

<p>The fact is that the change in the
prison policy began in the spring of 1903.
At that time conditions were just about
as bad as they have been pictured. The
generosity of the people of the state of
Oregon did not go to the length of furnishing
the prisoners in the penitentiary
even such common necessities as socks
and underclothing. Flogging was common,
and the hose, no less terrible as a punishment
than the whip, was considered a
necessity in the government of the penitentiary.
There was no common dining
room, and the men lived, slept, cooked
and ate in their cells. An exceedingly
limited and coarse fare was provided by
the state, but the prisoner who had money
could send out and purchase provisions,
which he could cook in his cell over a
small oil stove. The prisoner who had
no money had to content himself with dry
bread and bean soup flavored with the
smell from the cooking of his more fortunate
neighbor. Sanitary conditions
were shockingly bad, and at one time
resulted in a large number of cases of
typhoid fever. The spirit of the inmates
was exceedingly dangerous, as witnessed
by the fact that the officers of the prison
considered it unsafe to go among the
men without a guard. The Tracy-Merrill
outbreak was a fair sample of the spirit
of the institution at that time.</p>

<p>On April 1, 1903, C. W. James as superintendent
and Frank C. Curtis as warden,
appointees of Governor George E.
Chamberlain, took charge of affairs at
the prison. They proceeded cautiously,
but with a marked advance in their treatment
of the prisoners.</p>

<p>The striped clothing formerly worn by
the prisoners was abolished, except as a
mark of disgrace for infraction of the
prison rules. Flogging was abolished by
act of the legislature. Necessary underclothing
was furnished the prisoners. A
dining room was built and cooking in the
cells was stopped. The sanitary conditions
were improved. An orchestra and
band were organized among the prisoners.
A parole officer was provided,
whose duties were practically that of
chaplain. A prisoners’ aid society was
organized, which looked after the welfare
of the prisoners, both before and
after release. A printing office was donated
by the prisoner’s aid society, and
the publication of a small monthly paper
by the prisoners and in their interest
was begun. This paper was known as
“Lend a Hand,” and has now a circulation
that reaches across the continent. An
innovation worthy of special mention
was the permission of baseball games between
clubs of the prisoners, which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
prisoners were not only permitted to
witness, but they were allowed to cheer
and “root” to their heart’s content.
These and various other reforms which
were inaugurated during the eight years
previous to Governor West’s inauguration
laid the foundation for the success
of his policies.</p>

<p>Great as had been the changes before
the term of Governor West began, they
had been spread out over a period of
eight years, and while awakening considerable
opposition, had not attracted
much notice. When Governor West
came into office, notwithstanding what
had already been accomplished, he found
plenty of room for improvement, and he
went at it in characteristic fashion. His
“honor system” was put into effect and
with surprising success, if one did not
know of the care with which the cases
were selected to whom it should be applied.
The indeterminate sentence law
was passed by the last legislature, and
provision was made for a parole law
and a parole board to have oversight of
its administration. Various advanced
methods of treatment of the prisoners
were adopted, prominent among which
were plans for giving the prisoners a
portion of their earnings. The contract
system of employing the prisoners has
been practically abolished, or will be as
soon as the work now begun is completed.</p>

<p>A new auditorium has been built entirely
by convict labor. A weekly moving
picture entertainment is furnished
the prisoners and various schemes for
the improvement of their condition have
been put into effect, all with the result
that the burden of expense has been
lightened, and the inmates have come to
feel more as if they were still considered
human beings. The details of these improvements
are too well known to need
repetition here. It but remains for me
to say that, with the unusual opportunities
accorded me as manager of the
printing office and “Lend a Hand” to
observe the effect of his policies in the
working out, I am impressed not only
with the spirit of Governor West, and
the scope of the plans which he proposes
to put into effect, but even more with the
wisdom he has shown in the reforms
he has undertaken.</p>

<p>The fundamental principle of Governor
West’s prison policy appears to be that
“A man’s a man for a’ that.” While he
believes that prison sentences are primarily
for the protection of society, he also
apparently believes that the protection of
society will be best accomplished by helping
the prisoner regain his manhood and
self-respect, and that is the keynote of
his policy. I asked an “old-timer” the
other day to tell me how the spirit of the
inmates of the prison now compared with
that of the time before these reforms
began. He said: “There is no comparison;
they are as different as heaven and
hell.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_WAYWARD_GIRL_AND_THE_BINET_TEST">THE WAYWARD GIRL AND THE BINET TEST</h2>
</div>

<p class="center caption"><span class="smcap">By Henry H. Goddard, Ph. D., and Helen F. Hill</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>[This is an abstract of a paper published in “The Training School” for June, 1911. Dr. Goddard is no theorist;
his conclusions always deserve very serious thought.]</p>
</div>

<p>It was with a good deal of interest
that we accepted the offer of a prominent
probation officer to examine some
fifty of her girls who had been in the
girls’ reformatory, but were now out on
probation.</p>

<p>Some little experience with similar
groups had led us to feel confident that
quite a percentage of these girls would
be found to be distinctly feeble-minded,
but we were not prepared for the results
that we did find. In all, fifty-six girls
were examined, ranging in age from fourteen
to twenty, the average probably being
eighteen and a half. The usual misgivings
were had on the part of those
who knew the girls, as to the effect of
asking them to do the test, but as experience
always shows, there was not the
slightest difficulty. Indeed, the girls took
hold of the tests with great earnestness
and enjoyment, and, after they were
through, were very proud of their
achievements.</p>

<p>The results are summarized as follows:
One of them tested eight years, that is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
shows the mentality of a normal girl of
eight years of age; twelve tested nine
years; fourteen tested ten years; fourteen,
eleven years; eleven, twelve years,
and four did the tests for thirteen. As
the tests for thirteen have been demonstrated
to be much more difficult than
that age would indicate, <i>we may say that
four out of the fifty-six are not feeble-minded,
as we usually define feeble-mindedness.
The rest are clearly mental defectives</i>,
and could be made, or could
have been made, had they been taken
early enough, happy and useful in an
institution for feeble-minded. As it is,
they must always be a trouble, must always
be a disappointment, incapable of
bearing the responsibilities that have been
put upon them, and, what is worse, they
will be, as many of them already are,
mothers of more feeble-minded and deficient
persons.</p>

<p>To appreciate the full force of this, one
should see these girls and note their characteristics,
their physical appearance, and
those qualities and characteristics that
go to make up the type of young woman—those
things that make us instinctively
feel that they are responsible persons
and make so many persons even now refuse
to believe that such can be feeble-minded,
and yet here are the tests. And
more than that, here is the test of life—they
are unable to adjust themselves
to their environment and will always be
unable.</p>

<p>Perhaps the reader may be inclined to
say, “But these tests show that they are
ignorant and that it is because they have
not been to school, or have not profited
by their school experience.” But such is
not the case. These are not tests of
school training; they are tests of mental
development. Any person who has
lived in any sort of average environment
for the requisite number of years is able
to do these tests, even though he has
never been to school, even for a day, and
by failing in these they manifest their
mental defectiveness.</p>

<p>It begins to look as though we have
been attempting to solve the problem of
the wayward girl by beginning at the
wrong end. We have assumed that she
was competent and responsible—that she
was able to do differently, if she would,
and we have tried by various forms of
punishment to reform her. Apparently
we have been grossly in error, and it is
a fundamental mistake we have made.
We should have begun by finding out in
early age whether this child had normal
mental capacity or not and, if not, we
should have taken the case in hand and
provided for her such environment as
would have fitted her mental condition.
The past is gone, the mistakes cannot be
rectified; but, if we are wise, from now
on we will proceed in accordance with
what we are finding out about this class
of persons. Instead of enlarging our reformatories
we will establish colonies and
schools, where these girls can be taken,
as early as we can detect them, cared for
and trained to do the things they can be
trained to do; where they will be made
happy and allowed to live a happy and
measureably useful life under the care,
guidance and direction of intelligent and
humane people, who will make their lives
happy and partially useful, but who will
insist upon the one important thing, and
that is that this race should end with
them; they shall never become the mothers
of children who are like themselves.</p>

<p><i>A Prison Philosopher.</i>—Number 6203
in the Oregon state penitentiary sees
things thus:</p>

<p>Men are like cigars. Often you cannot
tell by the wrapper what the filler
is. Sometimes a good old stogie is more
popular than an imported celebrity. Some
men are all right in the show-case on
display, but are great disappointments
when you get them home. No matter
how fine a man is, eventually he meets
his match. A “two-fer” often puts on as
many airs as a fifty-center. Some men
never get to the front at all except in
campaigns. Some are very fancy outside
and are selected for presents. Others
have a rough exterior, but spread cheer
and comfort all about them because of
what is inside. But all men, as all cigars,
good or bad, two-fers, stogies, rich or
poor, come to ashes at last.</p>

<hr class="r5">
<p><i>Sterilization in New Jersey.</i>—Governor
Wilson has announced the members
of the commission provided for in the
sterilization bill passed at the last session
of the legislature. The bill stipulates
that George O. Osborne, head
keeper of the New Jersey state prison;
Dr. Frank Moore, superintendent of the
Rahway reformatory, and Dr. George
B. Wight, commissioner of charities
and corrections, shall be members of the
commission ex-officio. The Governor
has named Dr. Henry D. Costill, of
Trenton, and Dr. Alexander Marcy, jr.,
of Burlington, as the two other members.
Dr. Costill’s term is for three
years and Dr. Marcy’s for five years.</p>

<p>The bill provides for the sterilization
of such criminally insane persons and
defectives as in the judgment of the
commission it would be wise to treat
thus.</p>

<hr class="r5">
<p><i>Big Brothers Show Results.</i>—The big
brothers movement in New York has
been given a 230-acre farm in the suburbs
of Trenton, N. J., and $4,000 cash
from two anonymous persons.</p>

<p>In the last year 2,195 boys, nearly all
of whom had appeared in children’s
court, came under the influence of the
big brothers; of this number only ninety
had to be brought a second time before
the court. Of the total, 1,208 boys were
cared for by the movement in 1910; 840
more were arraigned in children’s court
this year on various charges; 117 came
from institutions, and 1,202 applied at
the office for advice or to seek employment.</p>

<p>All for whom places were obtained
proved efficient. Permanent homes outside
the city were obtained for thirty-seven,
and but one could not withstand
the lure of the city and moving picture
shows, and returned.</p>
<hr class="r5">

<p><i>Making Prisoners Useful.</i>—At the
federal aid good roads convention of the
American automobile association in
Washington on January 16 and 17, 1912,
a session will be devoted to the question
of the utilization of prisoners in road
building; speakers will be heard from
the national committee on prison labor
and the American federation of labor.</p>

<hr class="r5">
<p>To increase the output of the state
nurseries of New York to 12,000,000
trees per year, the state conservation
commission will establish a nursery at
the Great Meadows prison at Comstock.</p>
<hr class="r5">

<p>A class in road building, composed of
more than 200 long term convicts, has
been formed at the Kansas penitentiary
at Lansing, and this fall and winter they
will learn the fine points of highway construction
and building boulevards around
the prison. Next spring it is hoped to
have a gang of at least 250 men, all experts,
who will be put to work on the
river boulevard which is to connect Leavenworth
and Kansas City.</p>
<hr class="r5">

<p>Warden John E. Hoyle, of the California
state penitentiary, is planning to
manufacture safes by skilled workmen
serving sentences for bank robberies and
safe blowing. In trying out the plan he
has secured admirable results, as proof
of which he displays a vault in his office
which was reconstructed from worn out
articles by prisoners under sentence of
10 years’ imprisonment for robbing a
safe. A man who is a skilled mechanic
will take charge of that division of the
machine shop where the manufacture of
safes will be carried on.</p>
<hr class="r5">

<p><i>Trouble in Ireland.</i>—A strange fault
has been found with Irish jails. The
general prisons board reports that the institutions
have become so comfortable
and attractive that short sentences, far
from having a reformatory effect, seem
to prompt the person once in prison to
get back to the domicile as soon as he
can. These short sentence prisoners are
not in long enough to receive the value
of any real reform and are out just long
enough to keep themselves confirmed in
their vicious habits. So it happens that
the board has recommended longer sentences
for two reasons, one that some
real reform may be inculcated and the
other that jail may be made so tedious
that culprits will be less ready to seek
the institution as a haven of snug refuge
and ease for a time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>The board makes the recommendation
that prisoners of education be given instruction
and a chance to study and that
others be taught such things as will tend
to increase their usefulness and earning
capacity in the world. A plan is also
recommended whereby superintendents
of prisons shall keep in communication
with employers to the end that when
prisoners are discharged they may be
given work as soon as possible.</p>

<p><i>An Excellent Editorial.</i>—Score one
for the Boston (Mass.) Transcript,
which says:</p>

<p>“There may have been valid reasons
for pardoning a man who has served
four years in our state prison for forging
checks and since then has been in the
Springfield jail for another offense, but
it is hardly treating our neighbors well
that one of the conditions of his pardon
is that he shall leave the state. If he is
entitled to pardon at all he is entitled to
a chance to prove that he is worthy of it
in the jurisdiction where his offenses
were committed. It looks too much like
passing our burdens on to others. We
have criticised the Italian government on
the alleged charge that, instead of being
at the expense and trouble of punishing
its own criminals it has frequently connived
at their emigration to this country.
There is ethically not much difference
between that and our own practices.
Every state should be responsible
for its own offenders. We do not want
the ‘undesirable citizens’ from other
countries or commonwealths passed upon
us and doubtless other states feel the
same way about it.”</p>

<hr class="r5">
<p>“<i>Easy Money.</i>”—Attention has been
called by a Boston newspaper to the vitality
which the so-called “Spanish prisoner”
swindle exhibits, despite the repeated
exposures to which the game has
been subjected, by the press of the country.
Communities in New England,
equally with other sections of the country,
continue to report the receipt of
fake appeals, along with the extravagant
promises of rewards if money is sent on,
by which the languishing prisoner may
be released from prison, and thus enabled
to enter upon possession of his
gigantic fortune. The appeals, it is easy
to perceive, would not be sent to individuals
where the swindle has been laid
bare, time and again, if out of the batch
of people thus addressed, gullibles were
not found in number sufficient to render
the game a profitable one to the swindlers.</p>
<hr class="r5">

<p><i>How Many Prisoners Are Innocent?</i>—In
a report read at the Omaha annual
meeting of the American prison association,
Frank L. Randall, chairman of the
committee on reformatory work and parole,
reported that the committee devoted
an entire year to its search for a
case of capital punishment wherein there
was a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of
the victim, and so far has discovered not
a single definite case of the kind. This
search was carried on in every prison in
the United States and in Canada, a personal
letter having been written to the
warden of every state prison in both
countries, and each official was asked the
following questions:</p>

<p>1. Have you personal knowledge of
the execution of any person, on conviction
of murder, whom you believe, from
subsequent developments, to have been
innocent?</p>

<p>2. Have you personal knowledge of
the imprisonment, on conviction of heinous
crime, of any person whom you believe,
from subsequent developments, to
have been innocent?</p>

<p>3. If either of the last two questions
is answered in the affirmative, was the
victim a worthy person?</p>

<p>To the first question every warden in
the United States and Canada answered
“No” unequivocally, with the exception
of R. W. McClaughry, warden of the
government prison at Fort Leavenworth,
Kansas. Colonel McClaughry was not
sure, but said: “I know of one or two
who may, in my opinion, have been executed
wrongly.”</p>

<p>Warden Fogarty, of the Indiana state
prison, wrote: “I have no knowledge,
personally, of the execution of an innocent
person; however, I have no doubt
whatever that some innocent men have
been executed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>To the second question, however, a
number of prison officials answered
“Yes,” qualifying their statements by answering
question No. 3 with a negative
answer. For instance, Warden McClaughry,
of the government prison, answered,
“Yes, a very few,” adding, “In
no case could the party have been called
worthy.”</p>

<p>Warden Alston, of Wyoming, says:
“Yes. I am confident that I know of
one man in our state who was convicted
and sent here who was innocent. But,”
adds the warden, in answering No. 3,
“he was of a drunken disposition, and
had he been a sober man would never
even have been suspected or accused.”</p>

<p>Warden Russell, of Marquette, writes:
“I don’t think from my experience as a
warden of this prison that the courts
make many mistakes.” However, Dr.
Gilmour, of Toronto, answers question
No. 2 “Yes,” and adds as an answer to
No. 3: “Most worthy, and results sadder
than sad.” Superintendent C. C.
McClaughry, of Boonville, Mo., answers
“Yes” to both No. 2 and No. 3.</p>

<p>Warden Fuller, of Ionia, Mich.,
writes: “During the seventeen years I
have been warden I know of only one
case of wrongful conviction for offences
against property. One prisoner was sent
here for stealing a cow, and another
prisoner afterward confessed that he
had committed the crime charged against
the other man, in order to get rid of the
man with whose wife he was infatuated.”</p>

<p>Warden Fogarty, of Indiana state
prison, writes: “I have not been convinced
by subsequent development that
any man convicted and sentenced here
for a heinous crime is innocent.”</p>

<p>The case from the western penitentiary,
Pittsburgh, wherein a prisoner
who served fifteen years was pardoned,
was pensioned by Carnegie and heralded
as innocent, is treated in the following
report: “Your committee had previously
taken pains to write to the warden of the
prison mentioned, but the information
elicited did not indicate that the prisoner
had been declared innocent, but was to
the effect that the man had been discharged
in the usual way—on recommendation—some
doubt having been
raised.”</p>

<p>The writer of the report says: “The
writer has for some years made it a
practice to follow up the correspondence
or otherwise the most widely published
and sensational accounts of hardships experienced
by innocent persons under judicial
conviction, and has been surprised
at the meagre ground upon which such
reports rest, though he finds that they
are quite generally credited by the reading
public.</p>

<p>“Perhaps his (the secretary’s) report
may tend to establish confidence in the
courts on the part of those who are not
informed and who have neither the
means nor the time, even if they have
the inclination, to inform themselves, and
it might be a good beginning in the effort
on the part of the institutions to be
understood by the public.”</p>

<hr class="r5">
<p><i>Annual Conference of New York
Magistrates.</i>—A number of important
problems before the judges of police
courts and children’s courts will be discussed
and acted upon at the third annual
state conference of magistrates,
which will meet in Albany on December
8 and 9.</p>

<p>One of the principal subjects to be discussed
relates to the need of a state reformatory
for male misdemeanants between
16 and 21 years of age. Courts
outside of New York city have no suitable
institutions to which to commit offenders
of this class. A special feature
of the conference will be a stereopticon
lecture on the detection and treatment
of defendants who are mentally defective,
by Dr. George M. Parker, psychiatric
examiner for the New York prison
association. Dr. Parker has lately examined
large numbers of prisoners in
the Tombs in New York city and has
found that a large proportion are feeble
minded or otherwise defective.</p>

<p>Other important subjects will refer to
the necessity of public prosecutors in police
courts, weaknesses in the present
methods of securing and using court interpreters
and the treatment of boys and
youths convicted of illegal train riding,
trespassing on railroad property and
stealing from the railroads.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
